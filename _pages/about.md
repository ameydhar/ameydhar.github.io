I am a Staff Machine Learning (ML) Engineer at Facebook, leading the Video Recommendations Team, focusing on user personalization models. Prior to that, I also delivered significant improvements for Feed Ranking and Ads Ranking models at Facebook since 2015.

I graduated from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) with MS in Electrical Engineering specializing in Computer Vision. I worked with [Prof. Shih-Fu Chang](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~sfchang) on Video Action Recognition in the Wild.

Before that, I worked on computer vision based Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) algorithms at [Analog Devices](https://www.analog.com/en/index.html). I obtained my undergraduate degree from [NIT Tiruchirappalli](https://www.nitt.edu).

I am interested in research groups working on Recommender Systems, Information Retrieval and Deep Learning. I like to work on problems where optimization metrics are complex, and good user experience is hard to formalize.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
