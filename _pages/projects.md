* **Large-scale Robust Video Action Recognition**  
*Columbia University, New York*
  * Extracted dense trajectory features (HOG, HOF, MBH) for human action recognition in videos captured in realistic unconstrained environments.
  * Proposed spatio-temporal covariance descriptors on the computed dense trajectories to fuse correlated features and create a low-dimensional feature representation.
<br><br>

* **Predicting Visual Aesthetics in Face Photos**  
*Columbia University, New York*
  * Utilized photographic compositional features and rules to develop an algorithmic approach to quantify aesthetic quality of photos containing faces.
  * Built SVM classifiers to score face photos similar to human aesthetics judgement predictions.
<br><br>

* **Linking Internet and Broadcast TV News**  
*Columbia University, New York*
  * Explored automatic speech transcription and other natural language processing (NLP) techniques for robust internet and broadcast TV news video linking.
  * Evaluated the approach on NewsRover live database of Youtube and broadcast videos and proposed further improvements.
<br><br>

* **MapMyNews: Aggregated World News Visualization**  
*Columbia University, New York*
  * Built a web application that combined interactive maps with rich content to develop intuitive yet appealing news geo-visualizations.
  * Supported browsing large database of news stories aggregated from multiple websites and presented as story maps.
<br><br>

* **Scene Text Detection in Natural Images**  
*Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru*
  * Developed algorithms to segment foreground text from word images in the ICDAR 2003 Robust Reading Competition Word Dataset.
  * Proposed algorithms for localizing text regions in natural scene images from the ICDAR 2003 Dataset.
